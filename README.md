### What is this?  
A IA that can generate MIDI files from other MIDI samples. This is a very early version of it.

The data_preprocessing.py extracts notes, notes durations, and bpm of the .mid file. And create .pkl files with that information, so the neural network can be trained.

Sorry my english. This is made with help of Grok, ChatGPT and BlackBox.
